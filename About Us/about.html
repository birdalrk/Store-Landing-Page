    <p>
      At Mangata & Gallo, we believe that jewelry is more than just an accessory – it's a reflection of identity, heritage, and artistry. 
      Our journey began with a passion for fine materials and a vision to create meaningful pieces that transcend trends.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each collection is designed with inspiration drawn from nature’s textures, colors, and rhythms. From blooming florals to the quiet elegance of stone, 
      our designs echo the natural world with delicacy and strength.
    </p>

    <p>
      All of our jewelry is handcrafted by dedicated artisans who bring decades of experience to every creation. We are committed to sustainability, quality, 
      and timeless beauty – creating heirloom-quality pieces you’ll treasure for life.

      <h2 class="mb-3" style="color:#d63384;">Meet Our Founder</h2>
      <p><strong>Levent Körk</strong>, the visionary founder of Mangata & Gallo, is a master artisan with over 35 years of experience in fine jewelry design. Born into a family of metalsmiths, Levent began learning the craft at the age of 12 in a small workshop in Izmir.</p>

      <p>After decades of perfecting his skills across Europe — from the ateliers of Florence to the markets of Istanbul — he returned home to pursue a deeper calling: to create jewelry that speaks not just to trends, but to the soul.</p>

      <p>His signature approach blends timeless elegance with organic forms drawn from nature. Under his leadership, Mangata & Gallo grew from a single artisan bench to an internationally recognized name in contemporary jewelry design.</p>

      <p>Today,  still oversees every collection, ensuring each piece reflects the same passion, patience, and poetic beauty that marked his journey from apprentice to artist.</p>
