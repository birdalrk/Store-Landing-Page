# Mangata & Gallo – Jewelry Landing Page 💎

This is a multi-page jewelry website built as part of the **"HTML and CSS in Depth"** course offered by **Meta (Facebook)** on **Coursera**.

The project simulates the landing page for a fictional brand, **Mangata & Gallo**, known for its handcrafted, elegant jewelry. The website is fully responsive and designed to demonstrate clean HTML structure, advanced CSS styling, and interactive elements.

## 👨‍💻 About the Project

This project was built from scratch as a hands-on learning experience and extended far beyond the original Coursera scope. I created multiple product sections, custom promotional areas, full navigation, and layout tweaks. Along the way, I also debugged GitHub Pages configuration issues, explored CSS visual hierarchy, and ensured responsive design across screen sizes.
